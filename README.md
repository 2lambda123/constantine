This library provides constant time finite field primitives for implementation of elliptic curve cryptography.

Warning ⚠️: The library is in development state and cannot be used at the moment
            except as a showcase or to start a discussion on modular big integers internals.

## Installation

You can install the developement version of the library through nimble with the following command
```
nimble install https://github.com/mratsim/constantine@#master
```
