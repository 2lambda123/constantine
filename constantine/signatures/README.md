# Signature schemes

This folder will hold the implementations of signature schemes.

In particular:
  - BLS (Boneh-Lynn-Shacham)
  - ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm)

Note: The BLS signature scheme should not be confused
  with the BLS family of elliptic curve (Barreto-Lynn-Scott)
