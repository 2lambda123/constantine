#           Configuration of finite fields
#
# ############################################################

# Finite fields are preconfigured in this file
# To workaround the following limitation https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/issues/11142
# i.e. an object can be parametrized by a compiletime bigint
# we instead have the fields, curve points and Montgomery objects
# be parametrized over an enum.

# Note, in the past the convention was to name a curve by its conjectured security level.
# as this might change with advances in research, the new convention is
# to name curves according to the length of the prime bit length.
# i.e. the BN254 was previously named BN128.

# Generates:
# - type Curve = enum
# - const CurveBitSize: array[Curve, int]
# - proc Mod(curve: static Curve): auto
#   which returns the field modulus of the curve
# - proc MontyMagic(curve: static Curve): static Word =
#   which returns the Montgomery magic constant
#   associated with the curve modulus
when not defined(testingCurves):
  declareCurves:
    # Barreto-Naehrig curve, Prime 254 bit, 128-bit security, https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/879.pdf
